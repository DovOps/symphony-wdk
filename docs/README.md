# Symphony Workflow Developer Kit (WDK)

The Symphony Workflow Developer Kit (WDK) is a way to build bots on the Symphony platform with minimal coding efforts. A
standard execution engine, provided as a bot that can be executed on-premise is capable of running workflows written in
a declarative manner.

Workflow executions are triggered by events (such as Datafeed events) and run activities. Activities are small building
blocks often calling REST API endpoints of the Symphony platform or can even be custom-made to tailor your needs.
